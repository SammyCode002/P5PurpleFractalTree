# P5 Purple Fractal Tree

## Overview
Welcome to the P5PurpleFractalTree repository, where art and mathematics intersect to create a captivating visual experience. This p5.js sketch renders a fractal tree with branches that rhythmically change their angles using a sine wave function, resulting in an ever-evolving purple masterpiece.

## Features
- An animated fractal tree that uses sine wave oscillations to alter branch angles.
- A striking purple color theme that adds a layer of visual intrigue.
- Interactive animation that evolves in real time as you watch.

## How to Run
To experience the P5 Purple Fractal Tree:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the animation.

## Customization
The sketch parameters can be tweaked for personalization and exploration:
- Modify the `angle` variable to change the branching angles.
- Adjust the `len` variable to set the initial trunk length.

Enjoy the dynamic beauty of the P5 Purple Fractal Tree!
